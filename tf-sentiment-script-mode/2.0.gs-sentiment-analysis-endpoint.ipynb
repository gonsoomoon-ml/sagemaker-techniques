    "#  Sentiment Analysis with TensorFlow 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon SageMaker provides both built-in algorithms and an easy path to train your own custom models.  Although the built-in algorithms cover many domains (computer vision, natural language processing etc.) and are easy to use (just provide your data), sometimes training a custom model is the preferred approach.  This notebook will focus on training a custom model using TensorFlow 2.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment analysis is a very common text analytics task that involves determining whether a text sample is positive or negative about its subject.  There are several different algorithms for performing this task, including statistical algorithms and deep learning algorithms.  With respect to deep learning, a 1D Convolutional Neural Net (CNN) is sometimes used for this purpose.  In this notebook we'll use a CNN built with TensorFlow 2 to perform sentiment analysis in Amazon SageMaker on the IMDB dataset, which consists of movie reviews labeled as having positive or negative sentiment. Three aspects of Amazon SageMaker will be demonstrated:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How to use a SageMaker prebuilt TensorFlow 2 container with a custom model training script similar to one you would use outside SageMaker. This feature is known as Script Mode.  \n",
    "- Local Mode training:  this allows you to prototype and test your code on a low-cost notebook instance before creating a full scale training job on more powerful and expensive instances.\n",
    "- Hosted training: for full scale training on a complete dataset.  \n",
    "- Distributed training:  using a single, multi-GPU instance to speed up training.  \n",
    "- Batch Transform for offline, asynchronous predictions on large batches of data. \n",
    "\n",
    "#  Prepare the dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll begin by loading the reviews dataset, and padding the reviews so all reviews have the same length.  Each review is represented as an array of numbers, where each number represents an indexed word.  We'll also pad shorter reviews to match a maximum specified length."

    "### Distributed training on a single multi-GPU instance\n",
    "\n",
    "The instance type selected above, p3.8xlarge, contains four GPUs based on NVIDIA's V100 Tensor Core architecture.  This presents an opportunity to do distributed training within a single multi-GPU instance, utilizing all four GPUs to reduce total training time compared to using a single GPU.  Although using multiple instances also is a possibility, using a single multi-GPU instance may be more performant because it avoids extra network traffic necessary to coordinate multiple instances.  For larger datasets and more complex models, using multiple instances may be a necessity, however, that is not the case here.\n",
    "\n",
    "To utilize all four GPUs on the instance, you don't need to do anything special in Amazon SageMaker:  TensorFlow 2 itself will handle the details under the hood.  TensorFlow 2 includes several native distribution strategies, including MirroredStrategy, which is well-suited for training a model using multiple GPUs on a single instance.  To enable MirroredStrategy, simply add the following lines of code in your training script before you define and compile the model:\n",

    "```python\n",
    "def get_model(learning_rate):\n",

    "    mirrored_strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy()\n",
