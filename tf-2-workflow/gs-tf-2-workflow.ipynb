    "If you are using TensorFlow 2, you can use the Amazon SageMaker prebuilt TensorFlow 2 container with training scripts similar to those you would use outside SageMaker. This feature is named Script Mode.  Using Script Mode and other SageMaker features, you can build a complete workflow for a TensorFlow 2 project.  This notebook presents such a workflow, including all key steps such as preprocessing data with SageMaker Processing, code prototyping with SageMaker Local Mode training and inference, and production-ready model training and deployment with SageMaker hosted training and inference. Automatic Model Tuning in SageMaker is used to tune the model's hyperparameters.  Additionally, the [AWS Step Functions Data Science SDK](https://aws-step-functions-data-science-sdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/readmelink.html) is used to automate the main training and deployment steps for use in a production workflow outside notebooks.    \n",
    "\n",
    "To enable you to run this notebook within a reasonable time (typically less than an hour), this notebook's use case is a straightforward regression task:  predicting house prices based on the well-known Boston Housing dataset. This public dataset contains 13 features regarding housing stock of towns in the Boston area.  Features include average number of rooms, accessibility to radial highways, adjacency to the Charles River, etc.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, we'll import some necessary packages and set up directories for local training and test data.  We'll also set up a SageMaker Session to perform various operations, and specify an Amazon S3 bucket to hold input data and output.  The default bucket used here is created by SageMaker if it doesn't already exist, and named in accordance with the AWS account ID and AWS Region.  "

    "So far we have simply run one Local Mode training job and one Hosted Training job without any real attempt to tune hyperparameters to produce a better model, other than increasing the number of epochs.  Selecting the right hyperparameter values to train your model can be difficult, and typically is very time consuming if done manually. The right combination of hyperparameters is dependent on your data and algorithm; some algorithms have many different hyperparameters that can be tweaked; some are very sensitive to the hyperparameter values selected; and most have a non-linear relationship between model fit and hyperparameter values.  SageMaker Automatic Model Tuning helps automate the hyperparameter tuning process:  it runs multiple training jobs with different hyperparameter combinations to find the set with the best model performance.\n",

There is a trade-off: using more parallel jobs will finish tuning sooner, but likely will sacrifice tuning search accuracy. \n",

A convenient option is to use a SageMaker hosted endpoint, which serves real time predictions from the trained model (Batch Transform jobs also are available for asynchronous, offline predictions on large datasets).
